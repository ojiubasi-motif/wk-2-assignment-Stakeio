## Stakeio 
[```Stakeio```](https://github.com/ojiubasi-motif/wk-2-assignment-Stakeio/blob/master/src/Stakeio.sol) is a simple staking contract that rewards users for staking the ```stake``` token on its protocol. the reward token is ```reward```. It sends the reward at the **end** of each staking pool to be distributed to the stakers. the *unit* and *fuzzing* ```tests``` are seen in the [```unit```](https://github.com/ojiubasi-motif/wk-2-assignment-Stakeio/blob/master/test/Stakeio.t.sol)  and [```fuzz```](https://github.com/ojiubasi-motif/wk-2-assignment-Stakeio/blob/master/test/StakeioFuzz.t.sol).
